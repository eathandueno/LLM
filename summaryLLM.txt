Project Initialization:
Created a structured folder setup for organized development and segregated responsibility.

API Interaction Component (src/apiInteraction.js):
Developed a Node.js script to interact with the OpenAI API, send prompts, receive responses, and save them.

Prompts: Created a list of generalized prompts.
API Calls: For each prompt, an API call is made, and the response is stored.
Data Storage: The responses from the API are stored in JSON format.
Data Processing Component (src/dataProcessor.js):
Created a script to process the saved responses from the API Interaction Component.

Reading Data: Read the JSON data stored by the API Interaction Component.
Processing Logic: Applied simplistic tokenization and performed necessary cleaning and transformation (the logic can be extended based on specific needs).
Processed Data Storage: Stored the processed data in JSON format.
Data Loading and Preparation (src/dataLoader.js):
Constructed a script to load the processed data, convert it to a suitable format, and split it into training and validation datasets.

Loading Processed Data: Loaded the processed data generated by the Data Processing Component.
Conversion to Sequences: Converted the processed data to sequences of integers representing words, based on a built word index.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and validation sets using an 80-20 split.
Dataset Creation: Created datasets by converting sequences to tensors suitable for training, with padded feature sequences and one-hot encoded labels.

Model Definition and Training Component (src/model.js):
Model Creation: Developed a simplistic model using TensorFlow.js, with an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer.
Compilation & Training: Compiled the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy as the loss function, and trained it on the prepared datasets.
Model Saving: After training, the model is saved locally to be used or deployed as needed.
